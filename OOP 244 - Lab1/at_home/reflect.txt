1. Namespace provides a scope to names of the variables, types and so on. The purpose of namespace is to prevent the conflict between names
names conflict. For example, there is a function or class under the name "car" and we use it in several
parts of the program. If we want to connect the other code which was written by other programmer which includes the 
different function/class with the same name "car", we can wrap our code into namespace and avoid the conflict between names. 

2. We need header files to connect to the programm types of files, prototypes of functions and other declarations, 
which are used in other module. Using header files helps to make our source code shorter and makes easier to apply any 
changes to our code. 

3. We should never compile header files because they include only declarations. This is supportive file.  
During processing of the header file compiler doesn't generate information for object file.

4. .cpp file is source file. We need it for implementation. It won't be compiled if we include it
in another file. If we want to use the logic again we should link it instead of including to another file. 

5. On this workshop I have learned how to break the program on modules; which files I should include into 
.cpp file; what namespace is;  what is the difference between .h and .cpp files.
