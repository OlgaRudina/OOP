1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.

This operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object because it works with a copy of result. We can't change the original value because it's constant.

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module.

a, b,c,d, e

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication.

- constructors
- operator overloading
- functions

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

I have learned in this workshop how to overload operators; how to work with the current object inside the function; how constants work;
what is temporary object.
