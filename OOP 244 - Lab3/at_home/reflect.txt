1) How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? 
Why?

There are 40 characters plus null terminator ('\0'). 
Null terminator is needed to mark the end of the string. It is important sometimes to hard code amount of characters in the string
to not allow user enter more characters then program needs. 

2) Your class declares two member functions named set(...). 
In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this.

The feature that allows to declares two member functions named set(...) calls function overloading. It allows
to declare two functions with the same names but types of arguments and definitions of these functions must be
differ. 

3) What have you learned during this workshop?

I have learned how to create an array from one integer number; how to get an access to each digit of this number;
how to use constructor; how to output float number of exact width (precision); the difference between private and public
parts of a class.
