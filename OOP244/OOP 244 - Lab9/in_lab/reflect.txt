1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

Compiler shows an error. It happens because compiler doesn't see some functions while it needs too see both template code and function code. 

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

Yes, you need to define the template function above main(). 

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?

Yes, I could overload the functions to do this lab. However, using templates makes code more efficient and avoid dubplications. Also it allows to apply one code to different types of 
parameters.  

4. Are the following equivalent? template<class T>
template<typename T>

Yes, they are equivalent. However if we declare a template template parameter we should use class.

Quiz 8 Reflect:
Example of templated class:

template <class myType>
myType GetMax (myType a, myType b) {
 return (a>b?a:b);
}


4th type of Polymorphism:
- Inclusion: selects a member function definition within an inheritance hierarchy based on an object's dynamic type.
