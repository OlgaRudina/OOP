1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?

a) Safe empty state is a state of the object when the object has a well-defined state from time of its creation. 
Default constructor sets object in safe empty state.
b) Another safe empty state is a null-state.

2) Describe how you have minimized code duplication.

Using constructor with parameters helps to reduce code duplication. For example, there are a lot of
variables in the Passenger program(every passenger has name, destination, year and so on). Instead of writing code and assigning data types 
to every passenger's variable we can use constructor with parameters and just add all data by calling this contructor.

3) Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the private data of the object referenced in its parameter.

canTravelWith(...) member function can access the private data of the object because it's declared inside of the class.

4) What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?
  
'\0' != name && '\0' != dest

5) Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

In this workshop I have learned how to use constructors and what is the difference between default costructor and 
costructor with parameters.

1. What is the benefit of using dynamic memory allocation?
- helps to prevent memory leak;
- easier to work with arrays;
- easier to manage the lifecycle of an object.

Quiz 4 Reflection:

2. What is the purpose of using public member functions?

The purpose of using public member functions is to provide the communication link between client code and objects of a class.

3. Write down a piece of C++ code that a) allocates memory, b) stores the string "OOP244" and deallocates the memory storage.

int main() {
	

	char* x = nullptr;
	x = new char;
	x = "OOP244";
	cout << x << endl;
	delete x;
	return 0;
}
