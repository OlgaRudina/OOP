1) Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before
doing anything else?

The copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before
doing anything else because it's important to avoid dublication which can provoke unpredictable behavior. 
For example, if there is an element "x" in array and we have a line x = x somewhere in code the program can interpret it wrong and
exit with an error or stop working at all.


2) List how you avoided duplication of code.
- constructors(default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, constructor with 3 parameters);
- operator += and operator = overloading;
- functions (to Array, isValid, digitsNum, isEmpty, display;

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop.

In completing this workshop I have learned 
how to get separate parts from array of integers;
how to use copy constructor;
how to overload += and = operators; 
how to work with helper functions.
